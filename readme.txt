I've tested this website with chrome, firefox and edge.
Works best with chrome, sometimes firefox doesn't display images, edge didin't seem to have any errors. 

The design for mobile with burger menu doesn't appear in chrome responsive inspector, I had to manually adjust the scale with control+scroll wheel on the site. 
I think this is due to how I structed the css file, I designed for the smallest screen first and then added the media query for the 2 other screen sizes

script.js contains the javascript for the burger menu, game menu and card game.

styles.css uses 2 media quries which effect the gallery flexbox and display the burger menu.
